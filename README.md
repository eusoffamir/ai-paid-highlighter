## How It Works

```
User uploads PDF
       ↓
formidable saves to /tmp
       ↓
pdfjs-dist extracts full text
       ↓
Text is split into sentences
       ↓
Claude AI receives numbered sentences
Claude returns JSON array of important sentence indices
       ↓
pdf-lib creates new PDF:
  • Page 1: Key Points summary (yellow highlights)
  • Rest: Original pages with header annotation
       ↓
PDF sent back as base64 data URL
User downloads it
```

## Cost Estimate

Using Claude claude-sonnet-4 at typical academic paper length (~5,000 words):
- Input tokens: ~1,800 (sentences list)
- Output tokens: ~100 (JSON array)
- Cost per analysis: ~**$0.003** (less than half a cent)

For 100 analyses/month: ~**$0.30**

---

## Limitations

- Text-based PDFs only (scanned/image PDFs are not supported)
- Maximum 120 sentences analyzed per document (first ~8–10 pages of dense text)
- Maximum file size: 10 MB
- Vercel free tier: 30-second function timeout (sufficient for most documents)

## Contributing

PRs welcome! Ideas for improvement:

- [ ] Inline text highlighting using pdfminer/pymupdf (requires Python backend)
- [ ] Support for scanned PDFs via OCR
- [ ] Multiple highlight colors by category (thesis vs evidence vs conclusion)
- [ ] Save history in localStorage
- [ ] Batch PDF processing
